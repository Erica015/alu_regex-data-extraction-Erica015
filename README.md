# alu_regex-data-extraction-Erica015
This project develops a JavaScript tool that uses Regular Expressions to extract and validate different data types (emails, URLs, phone numbers, etc.) in large text datasets. The solution will automate the data extraction for a web application to ensure accuracy or proper formatting and best practices in code quality and version control, lasting only for a few seconds.
This project is an interface for JavaScript data extraction where regular expressions are used to identify and verify key data types like email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, time formats, HTML tags, hashtags, currency amounts, etc., from large volumes of web text data. The solution ensures accurate and well-formatted data extraction for dynamic web applications while providing supporting evidence of notable clean coding practices and active version control on GitHub.
